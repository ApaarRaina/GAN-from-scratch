# GAN-from-scratch

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using **PyTorch**, based on the original 2014 paper:  
**[Generative Adversarial Nets (Goodfellow et al.)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661)**.

## What is a GAN?

A **Generative Adversarial Network** consists of two competing neural networks:

- **Generator (G)**: Learns to generate realistic images from random noise.
- **Discriminator (D)**: Learns to distinguish between real images and fake ones generated by G.

They are trained simultaneously in a **minimax game** where:
- G tries to fool D,
- D tries not to be fooled by G.

## How to Run

To train the GAN model, simply run the following script:

```bash
python GAN_model.py
