# GAN-from-scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** using **PyTorch**, based on the original 2014 paper:  
**[Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)**.

## What is a GAN?

A **Generative Adversarial Network** consists of two competing neural networks:

- **Generator (G)**: Learns to generate realistic images from random noise.
- **Discriminator (D)**: Learns to distinguish between real images and fake ones generated by G.

They are trained simultaneously in a **minimax game** where:
- G tries to fool D,
- D tries not to be fooled by G.

## Math

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) involve two neural networks:

Generator G(z): Maps a noise vector z~p(z) to data space(image)
Discriminator D(x): Tries to distinguish between read data x~p(x) and generated samples G(x)

These two nets play a minmax game
$$
\min_G \max_D \; V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]
$$

The discriminator D maximises this: It wants to classify real data as real

The Generator G minimises this: It wants fake data G(z) to fool D to think it is real

To do this in practice we employ the BCEloss function.

This also creates a problem where the genarator while trying to minimise this loss $$ \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] $$
It creates a vansihing gradient problem when D(G(z))~0 that means when the discriminator is good.
To prevent this we make the generator maximise this probability
$$ \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(D(G(z)))] $$




## How to Run

This implementation trains the GAN on the **MNIST** dataset. (The test one)

To get the random noise dataset run this script:

```bash
python custom_dataset.py
```

To train the GAN model, simply run the following script:

```bash
python GAN_model.py
```

To test the trained GAN model run:

```bash
python test.py
```
