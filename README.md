# GAN-from-scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** using **PyTorch**, based on the original 2014 paper:  
**[Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)**.

## What is a GAN?

A **Generative Adversarial Network** consists of two competing neural networks:

- **Generator (G)**: Learns to generate realistic images from random noise.
- **Discriminator (D)**: Learns to distinguish between real images and fake ones generated by G.

They are trained simultaneously in a **minimax game** where:
- G tries to fool D,
- D tries not to be fooled by G.

## How to Run

This implementation trains the GAN on the **MNIST** dataset.

To get the random noise dataset run this script:

```bash
python custom_dataset.py
```

To train the GAN model, simply run the following script:

```bash
python GAN_model.py
```

To test the trained GAN model run:

```bash
python test.py
```
